# Web Interface For Entity Search and Entity-Semantic Document Search

## Summary
This user interface uses [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) as the server. You need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) first. The backend simply wraps ElasticSearch call. The frontend supports both entity search and entity-semantic document search. Users can click a button to switch between the two. When typing # (hash token) in search input box, the system will autosuggest available entity types.

To understand the code, you need background in [nodejs](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/default.asp), [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) and [react semantic ui](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction). Start reading code at [index.jsx](https://github.com/forward-uiuc/Spring-2018-Entity-Search/blob/master/entity-search-web-interface/frontend/source/index.jsx) and trace other components from there.

## How to install
At the folder containing this README:
```
cd backend
npm install
```

```
cd frontend
npm install
```

## How to start
At the folder containing this README:
```
cd backend
npm start &
```

* If listen locally (localhost:8080):
```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
* If listen publicly (0.0.0.0:8080):
```
cd frontend
npm start &
```

## Troubleshooting
* No error but cannot open the webpage with a browser
  * Clear the cache, or use Incognito mode, or switch to another browser. Will fix this issue soon.
* Error EADDRINUSE:::xxxx means the port xxxx is in use (there is already a running server process)
  * To see if there is node/nodemon process running: 
  ``` aux ps | grep node ```
  * To kill other node processes: 
  ``` killall node ```
  * Now you should be able to start servers normally.
